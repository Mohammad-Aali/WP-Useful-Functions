/* Step 1: Create a new login page in WP root(public_html) with a PHP extension (FILE_NAME.php) and add the code provided below to this file: */
<?php
setcookie("FILE_NAME", 0123456789);
header("Location: wp-login.php");

/* Step 1 Description:
Please replace "FILE_NAME" with the name of the PHP file you created. The file name should only include the name without the PHP extension.
For example, I chose this name for my PHP File: WP-MyWeb@Dm!n
You can modify the 10-digit number between 0 and 9 to any value you prefer, keeping it as a 10-digit number.
*/

/***************************************************************************************************************/

/* Step 2: Modify your .htaccess file by adding the following code to it: */
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !^.*WP\-MyWeb@Dm!n=0123456789.*$ [NC]
RewriteRule wp-login.php - [F]
</IfModule>

/* Step 2 Description:
Please replace "WP-MyWeb@Dm!n" in line 4 with the name of your PHP file. Also, instead of the number range from 0 to 9, insert the actual value you set in your PHP file.
If your PHP file name follows a similar structure to the example I provided (with a hyphen after "WP"), you should add a backslash after "WP" in line 4 of the htaccess code.
After making these changes, attempting to access the previous addresses of wp-admin or wp-login will result in a 403 error.
Going forward, the new address to access the login page of your website will be:

yourdomain/YOUR_PHP_FILE_NAME.php

Replace "YOUR_PHP_FILE_NAME" with the name of the PHP file you created in step 1. For example, in my case:
https://example.com/WP-MyWeb@Dm!n.php

/* Important note:
When selecting a name for your PHP file, you have the flexibility to use special characters like @, _, !, and others.
However, based on the tests conducted, certain characters such as # and $ can cause issues. If your file name includes these problematic characters, accessing the page may result in a 404 error.
Unfortunately, the reason behind this specific behavior is unknown. It is advisable to avoid using # and $ in your PHP file names to ensure smooth access to the page.
